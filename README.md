*Cléric* is a little game I've made to learn how to make 3D games.

It's about fighting skeletons and picking up gold inside randomly generated dungeons.

Made in Godot using C#

Use the WASD keys to move , Shift to run , CapsLock to toggle running , Space to jump, Tab to show the map, F1 to toggle info, F5 to restart the dungeon and Escape to pull up the menu.

Left mouse button to hit with the mace. Right mouse button to use your held item. Q to change your held item and R to regenerate health using your mana.

The game has two held items : a torch and a shield.

You can also use a controller to play this game :D
